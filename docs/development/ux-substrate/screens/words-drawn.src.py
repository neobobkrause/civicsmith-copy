# DEC-259: the remaining screens keyed (K3268): every sentence a member reads on a screen is a keyed word, word for word
# (check_words_drawn.mjs). DEC-257 keyed the eleven screens on T49's path; this file keys the other fifty-eight, by the same
# rules: where a module's adopted row (DEC-252) and the drawing differed slightly, the drawing governs and the row is reworded
# (REWRITE); where the row is a design ruling's, or the drawing inlined sample data the row has no placeholder for, the
# drawing was changed; otherwise a similar undrawn row under screen.<id>. is reworded, or a new key screen.<id>.<slug> is
# minted. A sentence that carries sample data is keyed as a template, the drawing an instance of it; a sample record (a
# document's title, a file's name, a member's words) is marked .mk-data in the drawing and is not keyed.
# Run: python3 words-drawn.src.py (after words-t49.src.py), then node build_words.mjs, which adds these rows after T49's and
# applies REWRITE in its add(), failing on a reworded key that no row carries.
